## Bussines Problem:


In order to survive in the most profitable way in competition conditions in e-commerce, it is important that the products are presented to the consumers correctly. And after-sales reviews, evaluations, and correct calculation of ratings are among the most important factors in presenting the product to more users. With the correct management of this situation, called social proof, it is to provide more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers and a smooth shopping experience for the buyers. In addition to the reviews and ratings of the product, the comments made for the product are also presented to other users correctly. The prominence of misleading comments will cause both financial losses and customer losses. The correct management of these two situations will be an important milestone in order to survive in the e-commerce world where competition is high.
